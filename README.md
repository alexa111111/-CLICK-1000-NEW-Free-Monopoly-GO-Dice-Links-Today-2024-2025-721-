To progress through Monopoly Go, you'll need plenty of Dice Rolls, which is a crucial in-game currency. Each time you want to move around the game's virtual board, you'll need to use up a Dice Roll. To get more dice, you'll have to take advantage of daily login bonuses, complete more of the game, and take part in events, among other things.

You can also spend real-life money to get more Dice, but if you'd rather not do that you can just use Monopoly Go Free Dice Links instead. Clicking on these links, which are shared each day on the app's official Instagram account, and sometimes on Facebook, will help you claim Dice Rolls entirely for free!

Monopoly Go Dice Link not working for you?

Have you just tried claiming a Monopoly Go Dice Link and it didn't work? Dice links can only be redeemed once per Monopoly Go account, so if you click on a link and get a message that says "This reward has already been claimed" then that means you've redeemed it previously. If you get a message that says "This reward cannot be claimed" then that means the link has now expired. Keep checking back though, we are constantly updating this page with the latest links, and removing links when they stop working.

Are Monopoly Go Dice Links safe to click on?

The Monopoly Go Dice Links that we add to this article are created by Scopely themselves, and are totally safe to click on. These links originally come from social channels like the Monopoly Go Facebook, Instagram or Discord pages.

It is, of course, a good idea to be careful about the links you click on. But the free dice links included in this article come from official sources and are safe to click on.
